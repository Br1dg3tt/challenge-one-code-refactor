# Challenge One Code Refactoring

## Description

I was given code requiring multiple types of refactoring, such as changing div classes to semantic HTML, as well as consolidating repetitive CSS code.  In this challenge I also added descriptive text for every image so the website is up to accessibility standards.  Throughout the process of working on the code I updated my github repository through the use of git bash, utilizing the command line by using git commands to update the github repository via sending remote repository updates.  I also gave the webpage a specific unique title that assists in search engine optimization.  Finally I used github to deploy an accessible URL website so that it may be viewed from any browser.

## Usage

The website allow graders to see changes made by me to the html and css code provided for the assignment, as well as show the website was launched correctly and remains the same as the original layout.  The github repository allows graders to see that git commands were used periodically to push gode up from a remote repository to a github repository, and also shows that a readme markdown file and a license were added to the repository using github.
