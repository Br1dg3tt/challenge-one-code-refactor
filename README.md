# Challenge One Code Refactoring

## Description

I was given code requiring multiple types of refactoring, such as changing div classes to semantic HTML, as well as consolidating repetitive CSS code.  In this challenge I also added descriptive text for every image so the website is up to accessibility standards.  Throughout the process of working on the code I updated my github repository through the use of git bash, utilizing the command line by using git commands to update the github repository via sending remote repository updates.  I also gave the webpage a specific unique title that assists in search engine optimization.  Finally I used github to deploy an accessible URL website so that it may be viewed from any browser.
